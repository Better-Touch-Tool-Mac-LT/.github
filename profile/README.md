## Overview

Better Touch Tool unlocks the full potential of Mac <a href="#">input devices</a> by enabling custom <a href="#">gestures</a>, <a href="#">shortcuts</a>, and <a href="#">automations</a> that standard macOS doesn't provide. The application transforms <a href="#">trackpads</a>, <a href="#">keyboards</a>, <a href="#">mice</a>, and <a href="#">Touch Bars</a> into programmable interfaces that work exactly how you want rather than being limited to Apple's defaults.

<a href="#">Trackpad gesture customization</a> creates new gestures beyond what macOS offers natively. Define three-finger, four-finger, or edge gestures that trigger any action—open applications, execute scripts, control media, manage windows, or perform any operation your workflow requires.

<a href="#">Keyboard shortcut enhancement</a> goes beyond simple key remapping to create powerful shortcuts that trigger complex actions. Sequence multiple operations from single shortcuts, create application-specific bindings, and build keyboard control that matches your workflow.

<a href="#">Touch Bar customization</a> replaces Apple's Touch Bar interface with your own design. Build custom buttons, sliders, and widgets displaying information you actually need. Make the Touch Bar useful for your specific workflow rather than accepting Apple's generic offerings.

<a href="#">Window management</a> includes snapping, resizing, and positioning controls that make organizing windows efficient. Snap windows to screen edges, create custom layouts, and manage complex multi-window arrangements.

<a href="#">Mouse customization</a> extends to third-party mice with additional buttons, enabling programmable button actions that generic mice otherwise waste.
